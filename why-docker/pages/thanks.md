<!--
Q&A runs 15-30 min. Expect: "is Docker free?" (the Docker engine is free and open source; Docker Desktop is free for personal use, learning and small companies), "container vs virtual machine again?" (a VM carries a whole spare operating system, a container borrows the machine's own Linux; both matter, and the cloud server itself is a VM), "does my app have to be special?" (anything that runs on Linux can be boxed; Windows containers exist but are niche), "what is Kubernetes?" (a manager for many containers across many machines; docker is the alphabet, learn it first), "is Docker Hub safe?" (prefer the images marked official, like nginx; anyone can upload, the same caution as app stores), "can containers break my laptop?" (they are isolated, and stop plus rm remove them completely; today's fleet left the laptop unchanged).
Point at the three icons and say how to ask: type it into the Zoom chat, press the raise-hand button, or unmute and speak. Read each chat question out loud before answering it, so everyone hears what was asked.
